This project is a Latex template (maybe more then one) that will be used to help people create awesome Latex documents in their classes at UMB. The styling of the Latex file was provided by Patrick McLaren. The examples and content were provided by Joseph Paul Cohen.

Here is a youtube video to get started http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfQ2U2kG4Wg

I made a LaTeX homework template so that students at UMB can hit the ground running with LaTeX. This template includes standard features such as a title page, header and footer with page numbers and name, margin and spacing, as well as examples of LaTeX features I used as an undergraduate.

The template explains how to draw Automatons such as DFAs, NFAs, and PDAs. It's much easier to copy and paste a DFA then to redraw one. It also includes examples for drawing trees. These examples use the Tikz library so all code is contained inside the .tex file.

Examples for writing algorithms with numbers lines and scope lines for "for" and "if" statements are included.

Examples of matrices and tables are included. Many variations are used in practice and so many variations are included.
